  What we’d like you to do
We’re really happy to invite you to complete the next stage of the engineering interview process. For this we’d like you to design a vending machine that behaves as follows:
● Once an item is selected and the appropriate amount of money is inserted, the vending machine should return the correct product
● It should also return change if too much money is provided, or ask for more money if insufficie


  As well as the functional requirements on the previous slide we also want your solution to:
● Be written in ruby
● Have tests
● Include a readme - think of it like the description you write on a github PR. Consider: explaining any decisions you made, telling us how to run it if it’s not obvious, signposting the best entry point for reviewing it, etc...
The bulk of our score comes from how you completed these functional and non-functional requirements. We also evaluate:
● How idiomatic your ruby code is
● The OO design of your classes and methods
● The simplicity of your solution
